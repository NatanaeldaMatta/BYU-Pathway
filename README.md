[CSEPC 110] Programming Building Blocks: Assignments

<h3>Hi! This is Natanael</h3>

In this repository you will find <strong>almost</strong> all the assignments of <strong>CSE101.</strong> I hope it helps future students at BYU-Pathway Connect<br>
• I finished this course with an A+ grade.<br>
• All assignments are done by ME during the course, these are not the only way to do accomplish it.<br> 
• All assignments passed the score and were checked<br>
• Some assignments don't have the stretch challange done since I was lazy hahah, but most do.<br>

Please feel free to make changes, add more information or update the code if necessary, I tried to do my best and be as tidy as possible.<br>

<strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong><br>
Follow your instructor's advices in EVERY assignment. Before checking for something here, go and ask help to your classmates. They're really cool and are always willing to help<br> 
I <strong>DON'T</strong> encourage cheating on assignments, if you are really doing the course it is to learn, and these assignments help you a lot with that.<br>
I <strong>REJECT</strong> any charge of encouraging students to cheat, knowing that it is against <a href="https://dfkpq46c1l9o7.cloudfront.net/pdfs/148e250c14f5be811f0c42353b9d46dc.pdf">BYU's Honor Code.</a><br>
This repository has the purpose that, if any student feels stuck in a task, he can have an idea of what steps to take and how the operation is carried out.<br>

This course really helped me to realize how much I like programming and I hope it does the same with you, do your best to learn and complete the assignments, it will be a solido foundation for next courses.
This is an inspired course from the Church and all the instructors try their best to help us to learn and achieve our goals.

Thanks for reading!
Natanael.
